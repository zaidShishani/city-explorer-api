## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

1. they own backend repo on github 
2. have installed npm(init,express,dotenv,cors)
3. data about the weather(either your own server will have it) or you can use a thard party API 
4. value for our PORTs in .env also check it in .gitignore so it doesn't go to GitHub could be problematic when working on a team

and yea that's pretty much what you need to get started
